The packages necessary for the analysis and prediction are listed in the R studio file, and each step of the procedure is described in its own comment section. 

## **Summary**

**Language used :** R programming

**Results of the models :** Linear regression model has an accuracy of **91.24%** and Random Forest has an accuracy of **93.62%**.
